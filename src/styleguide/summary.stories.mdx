  ### This style system uses the following unit measurement:
 `8px (0.5em)`.
  <br/>

  ## What does that mean?

  It means that anything and everything that is measured throughout this UI library uses multiples of 8 and as such the measurements used will be multiples of 8. 

  ## Why eight?
 
  Eight is divisible by 2 and 4. 
  
  This becomes important for displays that multiply pixel sizes due to higher resolutions. For example, a resolution of 1.5 would multiply 5px by this number resulting in a half pixel offset — The result is an edge that appears blurred, caused by the antialiasing of that half pixel. Half pixels don’t happen on an 8pt grid system.

  Using a base of 8 also matches up to the default browsers base font-size of 16px (8x2). Some of the most popular screen sizes are also divisible by 8 on at lease one axis, which makes for an easy fit.
